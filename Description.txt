COVID-19 has caused major disruptions in the global economy. In the United States, companies in almost all sectors have seen a decline in their stock prices, but some have seen greater declines than others. The goal of this project is to not only visualize the data and identify trends that happened at the start of COVID-19, but to also understand latent variables within the data and suggest methods to build portfolios that can be resistant to such economic shocks. 

As part of the data cleaning and exploring process, I first analyzed the prices of stocks from the past four financial quarters (sourced from Yahoo! Finance) to see which companies have seen the most decline and which have been more resilient. In the plot (Asset 1), for example, we see that Caterpillar (CAT) has seen one of the steepest drops in this period while Walgreen (WBA) has shown a slight increase over time. Additionally, I used principal components analysis (PCA) to conduct an analysis of how correlations among the stocks has changed over time. By reducing the dimension of the data to two components, as shown in the biplots (Asset 2), the stocks were relatively uncorrelated with each other in 2019 since the vectors, which represent the companies, were radiating in all directions. This is in stark contrast to 2020, where all vectors were pointing in the same general direction. 

Successful analysis of this stock data could help guide market research into many new directions. It would allow both investors to make sound, data-driven decisions when building their financial portfolios and companies to understand potential relationships to other companies that they may not have previously considered.
